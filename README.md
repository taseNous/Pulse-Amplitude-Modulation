# Pulse-Amplitude-Modulation
This project focuses on M-PAM (Pulse Amplitude Modulation) wireless communication systems and their performance evaluation. The project involves:

    Implementing an M-PAM system for M = 2 and M = 8 in MATLAB.

    Measuring Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) under an AWGN channel for different SNR (0 to 20 dB) values.

    Comparing Gray-coded vs. simple symbol mapping for M = 8.

    Plotting BER and SER curves to analyze system performance.

The goal is to evaluate error probabilities and modulation efficiency in digital communication.
